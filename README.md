## Relay Northwind demo app

> This is a true story. The events depicted took place in Northwind in 1996-1998. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred.

This is application shown Component-Based approach on full power ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª.

Build using React, Relay and GraphQL.

[Live DEMO](https://nodkz.github.io/relay-northwind/)

[Live GraphQL server DEMO](http://graphql-compose.herokuapp.com/northwind/)

Internally implements many cool things:
- Connections with infinite lists and filtering
- Running Relay queries from component (not via routing)
- Display loaders when fetching data
- Build on top of [graphql-compose](https://github.com/nodkz/graphql-compose) auto-generated GraphQL schema from mongoose (MongoDB).
- Eslint with GraphQL fragment validation, Webpack 2, React Hot Loader 3.0.0-beta, last versions of React and Babel.
- Many thanks to @taion for `react-router-relay`, `react-bootstrap` and changes in `react-router`. Awesome work!
